tryThrowCatchDemo
=================

A small demonstration of how to use the try, throw, catch logic in php as well as composer implementation. 

I had a really hard time understanding the concept of try/throw/catch. It seemed like all of the resources that I found on it in the beginning were either over my head at the time or only explained it half way. 

Now it's been a while and I definitely understand the concept, so I thought I'd build this little reminder for fun and to try implementing composer from scratch.
